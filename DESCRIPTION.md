Koel (also stylized as koel, with a lowercase k) is a simple web-based personal audio streaming service written in Vue on the client side and Laravel on the server side. Targeting web developers, Koel embraces some of the more modern web technologies – CSS grid, audio, and drag-and-drop API to name a few – to do its job.


## The Story of Koel

My laptop went out of disk space – thank you, Parallels.
My phone has only 16GB of storage.
And I still have a good 40GB of mp3 stored in my external hard drive.
So I started looking out for an open source, or at least free, music streaming application that I can make use of.
I found a few. Alas, none was good enough!
In my desperation I asked myself this question:
"Heck, why not build one?"
And so koel was born.

And why "koel"?
It’s the name of a bird who sings non-stop near my place back in Singapore.
